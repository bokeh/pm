#### Anaconda (Mateusz)

- finalizing work on dual canvas/CSS rendering of `Legends` (PR #14028)
- added support for focus management to plots (PR #14112)
  - allows for automatic activation and deactivation of `WheelZoomTool`
  - adds initial support for key binding management

  - fixes a bug in handling browser default touch actions on touch devices
- improved cursor managment for tools in UI events (PR #14106)
  - specifically improved `PanTool`'s cursor and state management
- added a GitHub workflow for testing bokehjs with beta releases of Chromium (PR #14105)
  - workflow can be triggered manually or it runs on schedule 2 hours before this meeting
- improved robustness of bokeh's unit tests in CI with `--last-failed` (PR #14103)
  - pretty much no more test related spurious failures
  - other less common failures can still occur (network connectivity for conda, etc.)

#### CZI R5

- Gabriel's updates
    - Reminder: some of the CZI grant-related work is managed in a dedicated repo, [czi-bokeh-mgmt](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt). Some of the links in my update go to issues in that repo.
    - Had chat earlier today with Mateusz
        - Went through all GitHub issues labeled [grant: CZI R6](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open+label:%22grant:+CZI+R6%22).
        - Discussed how to [make Bokeh translatable](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/10)
        - Discussed how to address [modernise and simplify Bokeh's theming system and its accessibility](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/2)
            - Next step: Mateusz to outline preliminary considerations. These will serve as input for the first draft of a work plan.
    - Next week goals:
        - Find and close 1 issue, such as [#13027](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/13027) or [#6662](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6662)
        - Provide feedback on the [dual canvas and DOM rendering](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14028) pull request. Also test it with Safari.


### 5. External announcements

*Does the contributor team have any announcements for the broader Bokeh community? For example, new releases (candidates), upcoming talks or sprints, new core team members, and more.*

NA

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Add Gabriel to bokeh/maintainers GH team to allow him to review PRs in his area of expertese (UI/mobile) - Yes
* gentle bump - it's been a month since the last activity on the [discussion about adding Axe-core to Bokeh tests / CI](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/14057)
    * the draft PR needs a little more work
    * the axe-core specific portion may not be worth including in the codebase for now
    * can make it an optional, manual + on a schedule, workflow
    * precedent to inlucde work instead of stalling discussion, we can remove it later if needed
