        - Went through all GitHub issues labeled [grant: CZI R6](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open+label:%22grant:+CZI+R6%22).
        - Discussed how to [make Bokeh translatable](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/10)
        - Discussed how to address [modernise and simplify Bokeh's theming system and its accessibility](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/2)

    * the draft PR needs a little more work
    * the axe-core specific portion may not be worth including in the codebase for now
