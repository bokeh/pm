### Agenda

### Updates

#### Mateusz

- continued work on axis labeling
    - implemeting various labeling policies
- redesigned serialization API/scheme in bokehjs (and partially in bokeh)
    - decoupled serialization from `HasProps` and partially from `Document`
    - prepares ground for future protocol improvements (e.g. unify `NaN` handling)
    - improved coverage and robustness defaults' tests as a side effect
- made `api.plotting.show()` to wait for `DOMContentLoaded` event
- fixed double escape regression (issue #10604)
- re-typing resolved/materialized arrays in glyph views (issue #10594)
- investigating implementing views (model state) for viewless models (issue #10582)
    - allow to make bokehjs' models resuable (node.js, workers) (e.g. `WebDataSource.setup`)
    - don't expose bokehjs' state and internal implementation details (e.g. syntentic coordinates)
    - keep public model properties in sync between bokehjs and bokeh (see e.g. `Range.bounds`) 

#### Pavithra

- Working on the contributing guide
- Reached out to Data Umbrella to include Bokeh in their OSS resources

#### Philipp

- Fix to Jupyter Bokeh
- Writing about Panel-Bokeh extensions

#### Carolyn

- Working on glyph-size legend (blocker, sort of, on FDV)
- New showcase: scatter of demographics in Belgian election

### Actions

    - started working on testing serialization code and protocol
    - use dataclasses for structs instead of plain dicts
- finalizing work on more robust axis labeling
    - allow labels to be generic graphics objects (e.g. text label with an image)
    - multiple policies for reducing label intersections
- experiments with generating code from bokehjs' models
    - related to serialization/protocol work
