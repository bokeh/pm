* [name=Gab]
    * Ready to merge [CSS vars](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14349) PR
        * will eventually be an API
        * shouldn't be a breaking PR
    * [Color system](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14467) PR is nearly ready for review
    * I wrote up a short list of [requirements for a CSV download button](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/10567#issuecomment-2842067289) - would like to start working on this

* Pavithra
    * Talk at PyCon DE done
        * [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pc8TZZJx64Tif5Qios43ofJJF0os_Qw4/view?usp=sharing), video should be shared in a couple of months
    * Another presentation, with updates, at PyCon US on 15th May -- post on socials
    * (Design) Widgets re-design is in progress

#### BokehJS standalone TypeScript library (Ian)

* Work finished:
    * PR with changes for Bokeh 4.0 https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14431
    * Examples repo https://github.com/bokeh/bokehjs-examples
    * Possible future work on documenting API, more examples, etc

### 5. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* [name=Gab] [CSV download tool requirements](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/10567#issuecomment-2842067289)
    * two things needed -- a tool for downloading things, ui for filtering+configuring things that a plot-user needs
    * concern about being default -- becuase it'll need to be very configurable
        * if the config options are for the plot viewer (with a full UI), it  might make sense as default 
    * a data table view of the data is a heavier lift, and a lower-lift "download" could be a quicker a11y win
    * there can be different data sources, creating more decisions for the plot creator - hence the concern about making it default
    * CDS -> CSV is a good place to start
    * Workflow: one top level issue, and sub-issues for the stages
    * Potential: API, to use with a CustomJS callback?
 
### 6. External announcements

*Does the contributor team have any announcements for the broader Bokeh community? For example, new releases (candidates), upcoming talks or sprints, new core team members, and more.*

* 3.7.3 release announcement on discourse & bluesky
* Philipp - working on a panel extension that allows users to create custom components and map it to panel (and eventually bokeh) components
