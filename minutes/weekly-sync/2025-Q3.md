### 5. Discussion items

* Gabriel - Way forward for the csv button?
    * Option in the context menu
    * Default button in the toolbar
    * Bryan - No strong preference for either option
    * Bryan - Another option would be to have an API to convert the CDS to a `.csv` file. Much simpler than a UX option

* Bryan - Needs some help to Triage some open Issues.

* Simon: Testing potential improvements for version confusions in google search in hvplot. Will move any improvements to Bokeh

* Gabriel
    * CSV export
        * CSV escaping
            * TypeScript compile problem
            * -3.14159 -> '-3.14159
        * Methodology
            * Tool class gets parent
            * Iterate through parent.children (views)
            * Filter instances of GlyphRendererView
            * Get unique set of data sources 
            * Output those as CSV

Results of discussion:

- Security problems with CSV are fundamentally not Bokeh's problem. However, perhaps we can show the user a warning if we detect values that look potentially dangerous.
- The methodology described for getting all the data sources is sounds correct; however, need to show actual code in a branch to make an assessment
