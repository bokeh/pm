#### Anaconda (Mateusz)

- redesign of `PaletteSelect` 
  - allow generalization for new `Select` and `MultiSelect` implementations
  - adds support for vertical select and drop menu in different directions
- upgrade to TypeScript 5.6
- upgrade to Chromium 128 (in testing; update visual baselines)
- try out Ubuntu 24.04 in CI
- experiment with adding support for `int64` and `uin64` dtypes
- continued work on redesign of `Legend` and `Axis` (DOM rendering; CZI R6)
- working on focus support in plots and keyboard handling improvemets (CZI R6)
- trying to add support for source maps from TypeScript
- finalizing work on `ScaleBar` improvements (CZI R5)

#### CZI A11y grant (Gabriel)

- Accessibility testing
    - Chiemezuo has addressed most of Mateusz's feedback on: [#14032 make npx-compatible version of playwright tests](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032)

#### NumFOCUS Summit (Pavithra)

* Changes to NF Leadership & Governance
    * Look out for Elections
* SDG might see changes
* Unconference session notes: https://github.com/numfocus/project-summit-2024-unconference/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open


### 5. External announcements

* 

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Accessibility testing question. In the draft PR ([#14032](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032)), we used the docs as a kind of shortcut to have a wide set of Bokeh plots to run tests against. We haven't decided yet whether it really makes sense to make docs a dependency of accessibility testing. But, **if** it does, would it be okay to use the live docs already built on the web, docs.bokeh.org, or should we make sure to do a dev build of the docs (with the latest changes from the development branch)?
    * Mentioned by Pavithra: [Frank Elavsky's accessibility dashboard](https://quansight-labs.github.io/bokeh-a11y-audit/)

* Bokeh 3.5.3 or 3.6 release
    * Minor release next week? Yes. RC next week, release a week later.
    * A good cut of point, with minimal affects for downstream projects.

#### CZI Accessibility Grant

Gabriel and Chiemezuo cannot attend today's sync (written updates instead).

- Testing
    - Thanks Mateusz! Mateusz has given some feedback on [Chiemezuo's Playwright draft pull request #14032](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032).
    - Chiemezuo has also made a bit of progress with the unit testing

- Audit
    - Reminder: the auditing work is coming along and taking place in a public GitHub repository: [Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit)


### 5. External announcements

*Does the contributor team have any announcements for the broader Bokeh community? For example, new releases (candidates), upcoming talks or sprints, new core team members, and more.*

* Ian writing NumFOCUS SDG proposal: Make BokehJS into a usable standalone TypeScript library. In 2 parts:
   
    1. Architectural changes to BokehJS to make it work, as discussed in https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/13732 and started by Mateusz.
    2. New repo in bokeh github organisation containing some usable examples of "BokehJS + WebPack", "BokehJS + React" and so on, as simple as possible to make them accessible, just rendering a few glyphs and showing some interactivity. Then, very importantly, extending those examples with full playwright-based CI that can be run both on demand and on a scheduled basis to automatically test against the latest dev version of the BokehJS NPM package so that we know when it is broken.

#### Anaconda (Mateusz)

- Another knowledge share sessions about Views, will contninue the discussion next week
- Continuing work on Sliders redesign, dual rendering redesign of legends/titles/axes
- Experimenting with implementing new tools for mouse panning, relates to keyboard support
- Released Bokeh 3.5.2, another patch release in a week or so

#### CZI Accessibility grant

- Accessibility testing - Chiemezuo and Gabriel
    - Investigating ways to add Playwright to the repo. Current approach, in bokehjs/ directory run [`npx playwright test` (draft pull request)](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032)
    - Chiemezuo used Playwright to run Axe-core (accessibility checker) against examples in the [docs gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html). Our current thinking about next steps:
        - Axe-core finds less than 10 distinct accessibility violations? -> Create a GitHub issue and do not integrate Axe-core testing into CI.
        - Axe-core finds more than 10 distinct accessibility violations? -> Eventually integrate Axe-core testing into CI.
    - Info: [Chiemezuo's internship](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/open-source-internships/issues/31) ends September 30
    - Big picture end goal for the internship: a set of unit, Playwright, and maybe snapshot integration tests that will be marked as known failures. This lays the foundation to add more accessibility tests in the future - because with tests, going from 0 to 1 is much harder than going from 1 to 2.

- Audit 
    - Initial evidence: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit/pull/1
    - More updates to come soon

    * -1 for alpha/beta
    * overall a medium-lift
    * have a separate dev channel?
    * this is a long-term conda issue

* 3.5 release schedule
    * Today
    * scatter-glyph issue does not need to block the release -- we'll need backport this to 3.4 as well, so make this a patch release
