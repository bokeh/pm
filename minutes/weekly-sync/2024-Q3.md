    * -1 for alpha/beta
    * overall a medium-lift
    * have a separate dev channel?
    * this is a long-term conda issue

* 3.5 release schedule
    * Today
    * scatter-glyph issue does not need to block the release -- we'll need backport this to 3.4 as well, so make this a patch release
    * When does the default branch change? Immediately after the release

    * there are some custom tests
