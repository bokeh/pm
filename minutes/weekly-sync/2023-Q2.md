### 5. External announcements

*Does the contributor team have any announcements for the broader Bokeh community? For example, new releases (candidates), upcoming talks or sprints, new core team members, and more.*

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Dask and distributed updates. Ian tried to get in touch, no reply yet. Suggestion: write PR to their repo (Ian)
* 3.2 release: 
    * Mateusz: Today was inital target data, but two PRs still pending. RC potentially at end of this week.
    * Bryan: try to get even months for releases - having a release anytime this month should be OK. Sounds like there isn't a lot of user-facing changes. Towards the end of this month should be fine.
    * Ian: No rush, this month would be good
* Victoria: idea from Outreachy: have a quick intro for Bokeh
    * Bryan: blog post would be great
    * Ian: Overlap with other discussions, we have also talked about Video in the past
* Isaiah: Some weeks ago, Bryan mentioned holding back with Outreachy PRs for team to catch up. 
    * Bryan: leave some work in the micro tasks for the future, especially keep working on other issues in the tracker. Also, reach out on Slack/GitHub!
* Jim: Discussions with NumFocus (Katrina Riehl), taking on pyviz.org as a project. What initiatives could we suggest to improve cooperation between libraries, now that there is someone to push this? Reach out to Katrina or Jim, or open a discussion on pyvit.org!
    * Bryan: Harder part is getting people together... maybe something like survey content as low-hanging fruit to start with
* Isaiah: Building docs on Windows?
    * Ian: some issues are windows specific, part of it is more fundamental
    * Mateusz: No progress yet, will try to get that fixed
    * Ian: WSL is one potential way forward
    * Mateusz: maybe just create that file, no matter what is in it?
    * Timo: In addition to the general file-related issue there is also a Windows-specific issue if some paths that might be off in the BAT file
    * Ian: potentially also docker image - we need to make it better!
