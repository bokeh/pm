    * New repo in bokeh github org `bokehjs-examples`?
        * Mateusz - There is already an old one which can be looked at and possibly revived
    * Initially to contain my TypeScript examples and CI to confirm they work.
    * Later can add other options, docs, etc.
    * Initially will just push to `main` branch, when I've set CI up I will submit PRs.

* Timo
    * NumFocus CoC email sent out. Probably worth looking into (to update our existing one or not)

    * Only problem is that it only applies to `Issues` but not PRs
