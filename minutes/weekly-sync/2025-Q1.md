- [x] All -- Raise discussion about the new `Issue types` on GH
    - Mateusz, in practical terms we've switched
    - we can remove labels that serve the same function as issue-types, need to transition all issues to follow issue-types -- a github action could help
    - start with an issue, and then decide how to proceed
    - decision is to switch -- need to document in BEP
