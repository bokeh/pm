- [ ] Mateusz - Create an issue about transitioning to issue-types
- [x] Bryan/Philipp set up verified Bluesky account for Bokeh

### 4. Updates

*Active contibutors, especially funded developers, share quick highlights from last week, and the roadmap for next week.*

#### Anaconda (Mateusz)

- started work on `SizeBar` annotation (issue #2603), similar to `ColorBar`
- working on various regression fixes after 3.7 release
- investigating transition from Less to pure CSS
  - use native nesting, `:is()` selector, `color-mix()` function, etc.
  - potentially using postcss to support older web browsers
- finalizing work on migration of data annotations to glyphs (PR #14378)
- create some kind of showcase, especially Bokeh widgets (something like a GUI for conda). Might be a separate repo, maybe 3 or 4 variants of the UI (including Electron, web app, etc). Goal is to test things related to CZI, having one place to test all aspects. Will probably take several months.

### 5. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Upcoming Relesase(s): 
    * Window autoranging and glyph decorators will probably not be included. 
    * RC today, then a quicker release with 3.8 to include these things

    * 4.0: Ian is planning BokehJS to be fully working for this release

* Frank Elavsky, thoughts on the [accessibility audit](https://bokeh-a11y-audit.readthedocs.io/index.html)
    * First a11y audit of any large-scale visualization library
    * Some things might be outside of what is possible to fix, so hope that OSS community members will be able to work on different areas
    * Documentation at https://bokeh-a11y-audit.readthedocs.io/index.html 
    * There are dozens of documents, with an extensive summary
    * The purpose of the audit is to evaluate the status quo, not prescribing solutions
    * Looked at Bokeh in three sections:
        * 1. Plot tools
        * 2. Plotting interface
        * 3. Annotations
    * Findings ordered by priority (high priority for things that are the basis for a lot of other tings)
    * Highst priority: textual accessibility - having (hidden) text annotations and explanations. This is important for assitance technologies but also new users ir users with cognitive impairments
    * Second high-priority point: navigation design and screen readers compatibility

* Ian
    * New repo in bokeh github org `bokehjs-examples`?
        * Mateusz - There is already an old one which can be looked at and possibly revived
    * Initially to contain my TypeScript examples and CI to confirm they work.
    * Later can add other options, docs, etc.
    * Initially will just push to `main` branch, when I've set CI up I will submit PRs.

* Timo
    * NumFocus CoC email sent out. Probably worth looking into (to update our existing one or not)

* Mateusz
    * Should we adopt the new `Issue types` introduced by GH? - It looks nice and clearer than our old custom one
    * Only problem is that it only applies to `Issues` but not PRs
