### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Ian - propose recording people's longer term plans for the project:
    * Project roadmap https://bokeh.org/roadmap/ (Bryan: would make sense to revisit once a quarter - high-level overview)
    * Personal roadmaps: GitHub wiki
    * Other ideas for personal roadmaps that were discussed: Roadmap discussions e.g. contouring (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/12234) and WebGL (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/11369),  Start on Slack?
    * Iteration plans (Mateusz)
* Pavithra - We're planning to participate in Outreachy May'23 round
    * Join #outreachy on Slack to get involved
    * Commitment of time? Pavithra: Not yet, while we are proposing ideas (could be any sort of diea, code, documentation, community, etc). Bryan: With enough concrete ideas, mentoring becomes easier. One idea so far: dark mode for docs (incl. dark mode theme for Bokeh). Could use input on more ideas! Pavithra: Internship is 3 moth - for something an experienced core-contributor would take around two weeks to work on. Commitment: up to 10 hours a week.
* Pavithra - SciPy'23 proposal, let's decide on a time for scoping call.
    * Call for brainstorming, probably same time as weekly?
    * Friday 01/13, 8 AM Pacific!
