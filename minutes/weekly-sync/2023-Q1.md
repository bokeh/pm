*Is this your first time in this weekly sync meeting? Welcome! We'd love to hear about you!*

* Hi Everyone,I am Ajoke Yusuf, this is my first time joining the weekly sync meeting. I am active outreachy applicant/contributor who has keen interest in Bokeh project.Over the past  days that I joined, I have been active on the community channel on slack. I would love to witness the success of Bokeh by contributing my knowledge and quotas. I am so excited about this community because I have been an advocate of good visualization when analyzing data and I am happy about the smooth and seamless way of visualizating using Bokeh. I have started preaching about Bokeh to  the data community I belong to. 
Bokeh to the world.

- finalizing work on webgl improvements (PR #12704)

#### CZI R5 (Bryan, Jim)

NF contract ready, in touch via email - currently access issues

#### Demo of Lumen (Philipp)

https://lumen.holoviz.org/
Announcement blog post soon

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Ian - propose recording people's longer term plans for the project:
    * Project roadmap https://bokeh.org/roadmap/ (Bryan: would make sense to revisit once a quarter - high-level overview)
    * Personal roadmaps: GitHub wiki
    * Other ideas for personal roadmaps that were discussed: Roadmap discussions e.g. contouring (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/12234) and WebGL (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/11369),  Start on Slack?
    * Iteration plans (Mateusz)
* Pavithra - We're planning to participate in Outreachy May'23 round
    * Join #outreachy on Slack to get involved
    * Commitment of time? Pavithra: Not yet, while we are proposing ideas (could be any sort of diea, code, documentation, community, etc). Bryan: With enough concrete ideas, mentoring becomes easier. One idea so far: dark mode for docs (incl. dark mode theme for Bokeh). Could use input on more ideas! Pavithra: Internship is 3 moth - for something an experienced core-contributor would take around two weeks to work on. Commitment: up to 10 hours a week.
* Pavithra - SciPy'23 proposal, let's decide on a time for scoping call.
    * Call for brainstorming, probably same time as weekly?
    * Friday 01/13, 8 AM Pacific!
