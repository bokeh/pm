#### Anaconda (Mateusz)

- finalizing work on persistent selections (PR #12468)
  - allow only one region select tool at a time independently of gestures
- finalizing work on webgl improvements (PR #12704)
- working on canvas layouts (e.g. multi legend or color bar support)
- working on CSS variable-base API and theming
- renamed `select_every_mousemove` to `continuous`
  - also now all gesture select tools support `continuous` consistently
  - added support for `DeprecatedAlias` pseudo property
- fixed perfomance issues with `regl` due to interference with `source-map-support` (PR #12722)
- switched to separate TypeScript compilation (`isolatedModules`) (PR #12723)
  - allows to use third-party tooling that usually assumes separate compilation
- refactored `qbb()` and `cbb()`, and fixed usage error (PR #12725)
  - fixed probably a decade old bug
- removed leftover legacy CSS (PR #12715)

#### CZI R5 (Bryan, Jim)

NF contract ready, in touch via email - currently access issues

#### Demo of Lumen (Philipp)

https://lumen.holoviz.org/
Announcement blog post soon

* [BEP 10: Policy for Experimental Features](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/wiki/BEP-10:-Policy-for-Experimental-Features)


### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Ian - propose recording people's longer term plans for the project:
    * Project roadmap https://bokeh.org/roadmap/ (Bryan: would make sense to revisit once a quarter - high-level overview)
    * Personal roadmaps: GitHub wiki
    * Other ideas for personal roadmaps that were discussed: Roadmap discussions e.g. contouring (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/12234) and WebGL (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/11369),  Start on Slack?
    * Iteration plans (Mateusz)
* Pavithra - We're planning to participate in Outreachy May'23 round
    * Join #outreachy on Slack to get involved
    * Commitment of time? Pavithra: Not yet, while we are proposing ideas (could be any sort of diea, code, documentation, community, etc). Bryan: With enough concrete ideas, mentoring becomes easier. One idea so far: dark mode for docs (incl. dark mode theme for Bokeh). Could use input on more ideas! Pavithra: Internship is 3 moth - for something an experienced core-contributor would take around two weeks to work on. Commitment: up to 10 hours a week.
* Pavithra - SciPy'23 proposal, let's decide on a time for scoping call.
    * Call for brainstorming, probably same time as weekly?
    * Friday 01/13, 8 AM Pacific!
