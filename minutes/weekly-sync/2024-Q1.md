* 

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

* Demo of "floating" UIs (Mateusz): Symbolic coordinate system that helps to synchronize between DOM-based and Canvas-based UIs. Opens up the possibility for several improvements, such as multiple attribution from any renderer, displaying a panel in the plot, adding a toolbar to the select box from the select tool, add a context menu to selections in the plot, support for multiple dialogs and stacking order.
* Bryan: Mobile compatibility? Mateusz: That should work
* Bryan: Make short video snippets of individual interactions. Mateusz: Already planning to do that for the docs

* Bryan: Planning over the next few months to restructure the reference guide to make it less complex and heavy. Will create an issue about that!

* Isaiah: Also update the tutorial with new floating UI features? Mateusz: This will take a release or two until it becomes fully usable and be polished - then it'll make more sense to add to the tutorial. Bryan: Please make issue on the tutorial repo as a reminder to add this once it is available. Mateusz: Symbolic coordinate system has simliarities with scalar properties that aren't used much, there might be some merging and expanding of those features at some point in the future. 

* Pavithra: SciPy deadline approaching? In Tacoma, WA this year! Might be too soon for another tutorial? Might still give it a try - discuss on Slack!

### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

- Bryan: Ballpark idea of 3.4 release time frame?
- Philipp: second that, talked about rough themes for 3.4 and 3.5 releases, splitting up PRs.
    - 3.4: Focus on floating UI PR (Mateusz: sometime early february would be ideal)
    - 3.5: Focus CSS variables, unify/clean up of widgets (CSS would be breaking change) - Part of the reasoning: we expose at set of variables to define style, then could reimplement different widget that uses those. 
    - Bryan: Are we targeting Bokeh CSS or the widget'S CSS? 
    - Mateusz: Yes, provide consistent API for this (defined CSS variables with sematntics, etc) - that is why redesigning the widgets - to be consistent. 
    - Philipp: Variables will finally provide a guaranteed API. Once 3.4 is out, we should formalize this as issues/discussions in the repo.
