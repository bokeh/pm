### 6. Discussion items

*Add any topics that will benefit from feedback from everyone present. Please add your topics here while we go through updates.*

- Bryan: Ballpark idea of 3.4 release time frame?
- Philipp: second that, talked about rough themes for 3.4 and 3.5 releases, splitting up PRs.
    - 3.4: Focus on floating UI PR (Mateusz: sometime early february would be ideal)
    - 3.5: Focus CSS variables, unify/clean up of widgets (CSS would be breaking change) - Part of the reasoning: we expose at set of variables to define style, then could reimplement different widget that uses those. Bryan: Are we targeting Bokeh CSS or the widget'S CSS? Mateusz: Yes, provide consistent API for this (defined CSS variables with sematntics, etc) - that is whay redisinging the widgets - to be consistent. Philipp: Variables will finally provide a guaranteed API. Once 3.4 is out, we should formalize this as issues/discussions in the repo.


### 7. Actions
